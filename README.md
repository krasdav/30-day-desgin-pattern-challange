# Design pattern per day
### Study design patterns every day for 30 days and implement short examples 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Creational Design Patterns
#### <ins>Day 1 - Factory Method</ins>
`package org.learn.david.creational.factorymethod;`

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface <br>
for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the <br>
type of objects that will be created.

#### <ins>Day 2 - Builder</ins>
`package org.learn.david.creational.builder;`
`package org.learn.david.creational.builder2;`

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex <br> 
objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and <br>
representations of an object using the same construction code.

#### <ins>Day 3 - Abstract Factory</ins>
`package org.learn.david.creational.AbstractFactory;`

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families <br>
of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

#### <ins>Day 4 - Singleton</ins>
`package org.learn.david.creational.Singleton;`

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has <br>
only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Structural Design Patterns

#### <ins>Day 5 - Adapter</ins>
`package org.learn.david.structural.adapter;`

Adapter is a org.learn.david.structural design pattern that allows objects with<br>
incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

#### <ins>Day 6 - Bridge</ins>
`package org.learn.david.structural.bridge.nobridge;`  - Without Bridge Pattern <br>
`package org.learn.david.structural.bridge.bridge;`    - Bridge Pattern used

Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set<br>
of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and <br>
implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

#### <ins>Day 7 - Composite</ins>
`package org.learn.david.structural.composite;`

Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into <br>
tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
